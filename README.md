I'm a physicist and web developer who loves to learn new stuff. I like to solve problems and understand how things work. 

I enjoy developing nice software which is nice, fast and accessible to as most people as possible and, above all, solves problems and make life easier. I'm working in continuosly improving and looking to deliver the best possible solution at all times. I am always ready to tackle whatever problem that comes my way, no matter it's complexity and deliver a top quality solution based on building simple and correct models for the problem at hand.
