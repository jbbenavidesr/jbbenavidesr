I'm a physicist and web developer who loves to learn new stuff. I like to solve problems and understand how things work. 

I enjoy developing nice stuff which is nice, fast and accessible to as most people as possible. Over all I like that my work is always as good as possible, so even though sometimes responsabilities or deadlines make it hard, I try understand best practices and be consistent with what I do and why I do it. 

In web development, I'm a full-stack developer, though at the moment I'm focused on the front end. I work with plai HTML, CSS and vanilla JS and for some more complex projects I use preprocessors like Sass and 11ty as static site generator. In general I don't like the idea of frontend frameworks, but I do want to learn a little about them for understanding how they work and their usecases ([which is definitely not for simple pages](https://leanweb.dev/)). 
At the moment I'm working on leveling up my Javascript beyond intermediate concepts, Due to my background in programming I get the programming very good, but need to improve my approach to Web APIs and the particularities of the Web. Additionally, I'm learning more about accessibility and progressive enhancement.

In physics, I enjoy understanding the basics of how the day to day life works and teaching others to appreciate this beautiful science and be more curious in life. I enjoy taking different problems or situations and developing models that allow better understanding or solution. I'm currently working in finishing my undergrad studies investigating a model of percolation for the solution of jigsaw puzzles. I use C++ and python for modeling physical systems and developing simulations. 

Looking forward to learning more about data science, machine learning and Quantum computing and releasing a blog where I can share my knowledge in all of this.
